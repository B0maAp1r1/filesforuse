Activity A(i)
You have been asked to carry out research to prepare for developing a proposal for the 
digital solution. Your research should consider how digital solutions are used to meet 
the needs of different users within the energy sector, including:
• how hardware and software are used within the context of the industry
• newly emerging technologies
• how digital solutions could be used to meet different user needs
• the industry-specific guidelines and regulations you will need to follow.
Any notes you produce should be kept and submitted as an appendix.
Activity A(ii)
Produce a detailed proposal for a digital solution that you would develop to meet the 
needs of:
• the client (Rolsa Technologies) 
• existing and potential users.
Your proposal should provide a rationale for the solution you are proposing and include:
• the business context
• the functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
• decomposition of the problems that will need to be solved to implement the 
functional and non-functional requirements
• the key performance indicators (KPIs) and user acceptance criteria for the 
proposed solution
• a description of the proposed solution
• justification of:
– how the recommended solution meets the needs of the client and users
– how potential risks will be mitigated
– how relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements, in relation to 
software development and the energy sector, will be addressed.
