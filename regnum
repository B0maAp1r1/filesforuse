**Proposal for a Digital Solution for Rolsa Technologies**

This proposal outlines a digital solution aimed at fulfilling the needs of Rolsa Technologies, a company dedicated to green energy through products like solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations. The goal is to enhance customer engagement while promoting sustainable practices, thus supporting both the company's mission and its clientele.

**Business Context**

Rolsa Technologies operates in an increasingly eco-conscious market, where consumers are not only looking for innovative energy solutions but also seeking to understand their environmental impact. With the demand for renewable energy products on the rise, developing an interactive digital platform presents an opportunity to educate users on sustainable living and simplify the process of accessing green technology services.

**Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**

The solution should include key functional features such as user account registration, a calculator for tracking energy usage and carbon footprints, and a scheduling system for consultations and installations. Users should be able to easily navigate these features to receive personalized services. Non-functional requirements focus on ensuring the application is user-friendly, secure, and accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. 

**Problem Decomposition**

To successfully implement these requirements, several challenges must be addressed. These include creating a reliable account management system to protect user information, developing a database for product information and calculations, and designing an intuitive interface that is resistant to technical difficulties. Addressing these issues will ensure a seamless user experience.

**Key Performance Indicators and User Acceptance Criteria**

To measure the effectiveness of the application, key performance indicators (KPIs) might include the number of active users registered, frequency of consultations booked, and user engagement with educational content. Positive feedback and high satisfaction rates from users will serve as acceptance criteria, signifying that the application meets their needs and expectations.

**Description of the Proposed Solution**

The proposed solution is a user-friendly web application accessible from various devices. It will offer comprehensive educational resources about green energy products, an energy usage calculator, and a scheduling feature for consultations. The platform will employ straightforward language and a visually appealing design to engage users effectively.

**Justification of the Solution**

This solution addresses the needs of Rolsa Technologies by providing the necessary tools for both tracking energy consumption and facilitating services. By empowering users with relevant information and tools, the application fosters responsible energy use and aids Rolsa Technologies in reaching its business objectives. 

To mitigate potential risks, such as data breaches or regulatory non-compliance, we will implement strong data protection measures and ensure ongoing collaboration with legal experts to adhere to regulations like GDPR. Additionally, to encourage user adoption, we plan to gather feedback throughout the development process to refine the application before its full launch.

In conclusion, this digital solution not only aligns with Rolsa Technologies' mission to promote green energy but also ensures users are equipped with the tools they need to make informed decisions. By combining education, engagement, and efficiency, we can help foster a greener future while driving business success.
